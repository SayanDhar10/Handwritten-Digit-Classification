# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Classifier using PyTorch

A deep learning project that classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to accurately classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset. The model aims to learn discriminative features of digits through training and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.
