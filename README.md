# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
This project uses MobileNetV2 with PyTorch to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9). The dataset is folder-based, and the model is trained using transfer learning. It includes evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualizations such as loss/accuracy curves and confusion matrix.
